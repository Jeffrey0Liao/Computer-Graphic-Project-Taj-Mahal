# Computer-Graphic-Project-Taj-Mahal
The major idea of  this project is to replicate the construction of the Taj Mahal in 3D modeling with  OpenGL based on C++ programming.

## Introduction
The Taj Mahal is an enormous mausoleum complex commissioned in 1632 by the 
Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the remains of his beloved wife. Now the place 
has become a great place of interest in India for visitors worldwide. The major idea of 
this project is to replicate the construction of the Taj Mahal in 3D modeling with 
OpenGL based on C++ programming.
The overall landscape of the spot will be revivified, including the main building, two 
side buildings, the fountain, the plants, and the garden.

## What is done
1. Necessary data will be measured in Google Earth. A more simplified version of the 
model will be designed. 
2. The overall code structure will be specified, following the basic idea of object 
orienting programming paradigm for C++. 
3. Using hierarchical modeling to build the primitive model by using basic building 
blocks in OpenGL. 
4. After finishing the main body, proper textures will be rendered to various objects. 
5. Various animations will be implemented, mainly orienting the water system. 
6. Lighting effect will be added, including ambient, diffuse, and specular
7. Diverse viewpoint will be designated to deliver a better presentation.
